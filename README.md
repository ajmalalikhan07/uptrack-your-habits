🎯 Uptrack

Uptrack is a modern self-improvement and productivity tracking web app that helps users build consistent daily habits and stay organized. It allows users to create, manage, and track their personal tasks or routines — like reading, workouts, study sessions, or project work — all in one simple dashboard.

The app features an intuitive interface with emoji-based task icons, swipe gestures to mark progress, and streak tracking to keep users motivated. Uptrack focuses on minimal design, smooth interactions, and visual progress tracking to make personal growth enjoyable and engaging.

Built using React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, Uptrack is fully responsive, lightweight, and deploy-ready — designed for learning, productivity, and portfolio showcase.
